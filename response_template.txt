I. Lesson 2

* Challenge 1: Binary Message
Your example of a binary question: Is it raining?
How to signal an answer with your device?
Answer A: Thumbs up
Answer B: Thumbs down

In what situations will your signaling device no longer work?
If we can’t see each other.

* Challenge 2: 4 Possible Messages

How to send each message with your devide?
Answer A: fist
Answer B: 1 finger
Answer C: 3 fingers
Answer D: 5 fingers

* Challenge 3: 8 Possible Messages
Answer A: 1 finger
Answer B: 2 finger
Answer C: 3 finger
Answer D: 4 finger
Answer E: 5 finger
Answer F: 6 finger
Answer G: 7 finger
Answer H: 8 finger

* Challenge 4: Complex Messages
Describe a system you propose for sending messages with more than 8 options.
Binary (thumbs up and thumbs down) to have 2^x states
* Reflection quiz:
1: C
2: Name a random number
3: Name a random number from 1-64


II. Lesson 3

* Your Prototocol: List the steps and rules of your protocol here.
Start by saying go
Receive/send every 2 seconds
* Performance - what bit rate were you able to achieve?
Bits Transmitted: 2
Time in Seconds:
Bit Rate: 0.5 bits/sec

* Reflection quiz:
1: AABB
2: 2 Bits
3: We would have to know what each height represents and when to read the graph.
4: CAB


III. Lesson 4

How many different three-piece sequences can you make using $, &, and #?
27
What is a systematic way of finding all the possibilities?
Start with all the combinations beginning with one of the choices, then keep doing it.
[Bonus] How would you arrange them if they were a number system - for counting in base 3?
From left to right and then from up to down! Spaces can represent breaks.

IV. Lesson 5

* All 4-bit numbers: (use tab to create a table)
0000	0
0001	1
0010	2
0011	3
0100	4
0101	5
0110	6
0111	7
1000	8
1001	9
1010	10
1011	11
1100	12
1101	13
1110	14
1111	15

* 8-bit numbers with exactly one 1:
0000 0001	1
0000 0010	2
0000 0100	4
0000 1000	8
0001 0000	16
0010 0000	32
0100 0000	64
1000 0000	128

* Conversion Practice!
Binary to decimal
100	4
101	5
1101	13
0001 1111	31
0010 0000	32
1010 1010	170
1111 1111	255

Decimal to binary
5	101
17	10001
63	111111
64	1000000
127	1111111
256	10000000
513	100000001

Show your work: explain the math you can use to convert from binary to decimal. Use for an example: 10101010.
You use place values based on the number in the digit to convert it to base ten.

Show your work: Can you explain the math needed to convert from decimal to binary? Use 79 as an example.
Other way around

* Reflection Quiz:
1: If the last number is 0, it is even. Otherwise, it’s odd
2: 11 bits
3: 511

* Hexadecimal:

Show your work: How would you convert from hexadecimal to decimal? Typing out the small math problems you use to get there is a good way of showing it.
The first from right digit would represent one, and the rest going from right to left represent 16^x, where x is the distance from the right.

How can you convert back from decimal to hex? 
Vice versa


V. Lesson 6

Explain the steps of your protocol. 
We decided on a coordinate graph. Then, we sent each other the coordinates each point, starting with the x-coord.

How does the recipient know when one number ends and the other begins?
We sent each message separately to avoid confusion.

Do you need to modify the protocol when using a larger grid?
No
